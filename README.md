## Overview

This app demonstrates the power of
[Gemini's Function Calling](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/multimodal/function-calling)
capabilities, enabling users to query and understand their
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) databases using natural language.
Forget complex SQL syntax â€“ interact with your data conversationally.

Function Calling in Gemini lets developers create a description of a function in
their code, then pass that description to a language model in a request. The
response from the model includes the name of a function that matches the
description and the arguments to call it with.


## Additional resources

You can learn more about Function Calling in Gemini with these guides and
resources:

- [Documentation on Function Calling in Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/multimodal/function-calling)
- [Codelab on How to Interact with APIs Using Function Calling in Gemini](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gemini-function-calling)
- [Sample notebook for Function Calling with the Gemini API](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/function-calling/intro_function_calling.ipynb)

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with billing enabled
- A BigQuery dataset
- APIs for Vertex AI, BigQuery, BigQuery Data Transfer, and Cloud Run enabled

## To run the app on your local machine: 
- Change the dataset names to your own project-id and dataset-id in `setup.sh` and `app.py`
- Authenticate your local machine with your project name
`gcloud config set project your-project-id`
- Run `bash setup.sh`
This script will:

- Enable the Vertex AI and BigQuery APIs
- Install Python and packages
- Start the app

## Deploy the app to Cloud Run

When deploying this app to Cloud Run, a best practice is to [create a service
account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) to attach
the following roles to, which are the permissions required for the app to read
data from BigQuery, run BigQuery jobs, and use resources in Vertex AI:

- [BigQuery Data Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataViewer) (`roles/bigquery.dataViewer`)
- [BigQuery Job User](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) (`roles/bigquery.jobUser`)
- [Vertex AI User](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.user) (`roles/aiplatform.user`)

To deploy this app to
[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code), run the
following command to have the app built with Cloud Build and deployed to Cloud
Run, replacing the `service-account` and `project` values with your own values,
similar to:

```shell
gcloud run deploy sql-talk --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --service-account SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --source .
```
