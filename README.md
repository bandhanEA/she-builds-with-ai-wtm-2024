# Discover the world, your way! 

- This application allows you to create a personalized plan for travelling solo. Created for womxn by womxn. The meaning behind NomadNari comes from, `Nari` means for "woman" in Hindi, and in Japaese it means to succeed. In Korean, `Ri` stands for "beauty and grace". NomadNari aims to provide women with a travel guide that will help them succeed as a traveler. 

### Inspiration behind NomadNari
- As an elder sister and a friend, I have multiple womxn around me who travel solo, but only once a year because it takens months to even plan the trip, double checking the location. Why? Because of the research behind it. There are currently apps that help women travel together and help other solo travelers but there is currently nothing out there that creates safe trip trips for womxn. 
- NomadNari aims to elimate the time it takes to research and provide womxn with a list of safe locations they can follow up on and choose from instead of thousands of options which led to confusion. 
- A survey of 400 U.S. women found that two in five had experienced sexual harassment while traveling alone. Sexual harassment is the most common gender risk for solo female travelers.

- Why should we support NomadNari? 
- Research shows that traveling alone can offer several pros, including: increased self-confidence, personal growth through self-reflection, greater flexibility to tailor your itinerary, deeper immersion in local culture, opportunities to meet new people, improved decision-making skills, and a sense of empowerment by taking charge of your own experiences; essentially allowing you to discover more about yourself and your capabilities in a new environment.
