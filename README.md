# Welcome to NomadNari! 

NomadNari allows you to create a personalized plan for solo traveling keeping womxn's safety first. Created for womxn by womxn. The meaning behind NomadNari comes from, `Nari` means for `woman` in Hindi, and in Japaese it means to succeed. In Korean, `Ri` stands for `beauty and grace`. 

- The gender equity category this project is breaking barriers towards: 
    - `Women and girlâ€™s safety`
- This project aims to combat United Nation's Sustainabilty goals
    - `5.2 - Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation.`
    - `5.B - Enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women.`

### Inspiration behind NomadNari
- As an elder sister and a best friend, I have two very close single womxn in my life who travel solo, but rarely because it has takens months to even plan the trip, hours of reading reviews, and hours of double checking each and every location, route, and accomodation. There are currently apps that help women travel together and help other solo travelers when they think they might be in danger but there is currently nothing out there that creates a safe trip guide for womxn. 
- NomadNari aims to elimate the time it takes to research and provide womxn with a list of safe locations they can follow up on and choose from instead of thousands of options which lead to time wasting and headaches. 
- A survey of 400 U.S. women found that two in five had experienced sexual harassment while traveling alone. Sexual harassment is the most common gender risk for solo female travelers. ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344631063_The_Dark_Side_of_Solo_Female_Travel_Negative_Encounters_with_Male_Strangers])
- NomadNari wants to become a resource to help female solo travelers prepare for their solo trips inorder to avoid users being a vicitm of a crime.

### Why should we support NomadNari? 
- Research shows that traveling alone can offer several pros, including: increased self-confidence, personal growth through self-reflection, greater flexibility to tailor your itinerary, deeper immersion in local culture, opportunities to meet new people, improved decision-making skills, and a sense of empowerment by taking charge of your own experiences; essentially allowing you to discover more about yourself and your capabilities in a new environment.

### How we built it? 
- We started with a survey, we asked our friends and family that travel solo, how would they like to be helped while planning their solo trip and what resources would they like to see.
- The most suggested answer was a condensed list of safe places for them to travel to, so they dont have to waste hours reading up reviews. Hence, the travel guide. 
- We used the `google-cloud-aiplatform` Python package, and used the `vertexai` SDK, that allowed us to Gemini through the `gemini-1.5-pro` model. 
- We then picked `Streamlit` to support the front-end 

### How does NomadNari currently work? 
- The user inputs their prefernces on the form including location, dates, accomodations, travel, etc. 
- This data is fed into the Gemini model along with some Prompts to generate a travel guide for the user

### Challenges we ran into?
- As a millenial woman who graduated high school a couple of plenty years ago, Im only used to in-person hackathons. I personally faced difficulties with securely a team at first by going ghosted and then when I finally got into a team 3 times time after time with folx of complete opposite timezones on different topics but unfortunately everyone happened to back out due to their own personal reasons or time constraints which I understand, because life happens to all of us. 
- Regardless on November 6th, when the last team didnt work out, I decided to roll up my sleeves and found the right oppurtunity to do this project for my loved ones.

### Accomplishments we're proud of? 
- We were able to get back up and keep on trying to achieve our mission of providing a trip guide even after facing several challenges. 
- Deploying to production

##### Future plans include: 
- Account Sign Up/Sign In
- A Community Discussion Board
- Ability to Edit the Travel Guide and Save it to their Profile
- Ability to support folx with disabilities and pets
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Firestore
- Cloud Functions 

## Overview
This app demonstrates the power of
- Generative AI on Vextex AI - The `google-cloud-aiplatform` Python package, `vertexai` SDK, and Gemini's Generative Model `gemini-1.5-pro`. 
- Streamlit `streamlit` for UI
- Cloud Run for deploying

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with billing enabled
- APIs for Vertex AI, and Cloud Run enabled

## To run the app on your local machine: 
- Authenticate your local machine with your project name
`gcloud config set project your-project-id`
- Run `bash setup.sh`

This script will:

- Connect to the Vertex AI API
- Install Python and packages
- Start the app

#### We are working on updating this project after the hackathon is over and publish this project to create a safer travel experience for every women
